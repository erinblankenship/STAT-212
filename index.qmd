# Course Goals for STAT 212 {.unnumbered}

STAT 212 is an introduction to the statistical aspects of study design. We'll consider all stages of the experimental process. By the end of the course, you will:

-   understand the differences between designed experiments and observational studies, including the resulting conclusions that can be drawn.

-   be familiar with major experimental and treatment design structures, and what to consider when choosing an appropriate design for a study.

-   understand the impact of sample size, variation, and effect size on power.

-   be able to write down a linear additive model, correctly specify fixed effects, random effects, interactions, and model assumptions for the error terms.

-   sketch a skeleton ANOVA table from a description of a study.

-   understand data collection considerations

-   be able to analyze data resulting from major experimental and treatment design structures, including estimating main and simple effects, pairwise comparisons, contrasts, and model parameters.

-   be able to clearly write up the results of an analysis so that a non-statistician could understand the major findings of the study.
