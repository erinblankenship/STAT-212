# Split-Plot Designs

Suppose we are carrying out an experiment to explore the effect of cold storage conditions on food quality. There are two treatment factors: storage temperature (2, 4, 8 degrees C) and container type (sealed plastic, open plastic, glass, and aluminum foil). A food product will be placed in one of the containers and stored in a small temperature controlled freezer for fixed period of time. There are 12 small freezers available for the experiment. Each freezer can hold 4 containers.

What kind of treatment design is this?\

How many treatment combinations are there?\

What is the experimental unit?\

What's the problem?

\

One thing we can try is randomly assign storage temperatures to the freezers and randomly assign food products to storage containers within each freezer. The storage temperature is applied to all food samples in a freezer.

Experimental unit for storage temperature:

\
\
\
\
\

The storage container is randomized separately, so the experimental unit for storage container:

\
\
\
\

So, we have two different sizes of experimental units for the two different factors in the experiment. Designs in which there are two sizes of experimental unit are called **split-plot designs**.

\newpage

Split-plot designs are frequently used for factorial experiments, and may use CRD, RCBD, row-column, or incomplete block designs. The underlying principle of split-plots is

\
\
\
\
\
\
\

This means each whole unit becomes a block for the subunit treatments.

Consider the following design structure. We have Factor A (four levels) laid out in 3 randomized complete blocks.

| A4  | A1  | A2  | A3  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|

|     |     |     |     |

: Block 3 {#tbl-third}

Factor A laid out in 3 randomized complete blocks
:::

A second Factor B (2 levels), can be superimposed by dividing each A unit into two subunits and assigning the two B treatment levels to these subunits.

|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| b1  | b2  | b2  | b1  |
| b2  | b1  | b1  | b2  |

: Block 3 {#tbl-third}

Factor A laid out in 3 randomized complete blocks, with each A unit subdivided into two subunits.
:::

Here the A units are the whole units and the B units are the subunits.

Note the randomization happens in two stages.

\
\
\
\
\

Each whole plot may be considered as a block for Factor B, but it is not a complete block for the full set of treatments.

\newpage

Why might we use split-plot designs?

-   Treatments associated with levels of one (or more) of the factors require larger amounts of experimental material than do treatments for other factors.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

-   An additional factor could be added to the experiment to increase its scope.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

-   From previous experiments or literature, we know that larger differences are expected among one factor than another.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

-   We need greater precision for comparisons among some factors than we do for comparison among others.

\
\
\
\
\

\newpage

Big picture summary: variation among split-plot units is expected to be less than variation among whole plot units. This implies

\
\
\
\
\
\

As mentioned earlier, we can use split-plots in combination with any experimental design.

## Model and Analysis of Variance

To determine the appropriate model, we'll start with the whole/main plot. Consider the following whole plot arrangement

| A1  | A2  | A1  | A1  | A2  | A2  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|     |     |     |     |     |     |

Let's sketch the ANOVA table for this arrangement

\
\
\
\
\
\
\

Now let's look only at the subplot arrangement:

\

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| B1  | B2  | B2  | B1  | B2  | B1  |
| B2  | B1  | B1  | B2  | B1  | B2  |

And sketch its ANOVA table

\
\
\
\
\
\

\newpage

In order to get the main/whole unit analysis, the "block" is partitioned. The error from the subplot analysis can also be partitioned as each component times B, so we can examine the A $\times$ B interaction. If we put these two analyses together, we get (for the CRD):

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

If the main/whole plot is laid out in randomized complete blocks, the ANOVA table looks like this:

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

The model for the split-plot design incorporates both the whole plot and the sub plot. Without blocks, the model is

\
\
\
\
\

\newpage

Tests of hypothesis in the split-plot will be constructed differently than we've seen before. To see this, let's review the ANOVA table (for the CRD) for a regular factorial:

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

Now let's compare this with the ANOVA table for the split-plot (still CRD) with the expected mean squares:

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

This leads to different $F$ statistics.

For testing the null hypothesis H$_0: \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \cdots = \alpha_a = 0$

\
\
\
\

For testing the null hypothesis H$_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \cdots = \beta_b = 0$

\
\
\
\

For testing the null hypothesis H$_0: (\alpha\beta)_{11} = \cdots = (\alpha\beta)_{ab} = 0$

\
\

\newpage

Using these split units tends to mean

-   Tests of main plot effects

\
\
\
\
\
\

-   Tests of sub plot effects

\
\
\
\

## Analysis in SAS

To correctly analyze the data in SAS (or any software), we have to identify the model terms correctly. Consider the following (very small) example:

::: center
|             |             |             |             |            |             |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
|             | Replication |    (sub     |    unit     |   level)   |             |
|      1      |      2      |      3      |      4      |     5      |      6      |
| A1 (R1, wp) | A2 (R1, wp) | A1 (R2, wp) | A1 (R3, wp) | A2 (R2,wp) | A2 (R3, wp) |
|  B2 (5.22)  |  B1 (6.52)  |  B1 (6.13)  |  B1 (5.77)  | B2 (5.81)  |  B2 (5.49)  |
|  B1 (5.61)  |  B2 (5.78)  |  B2 (6.14)  |  B2 (6.23)  | B1 (6.43)  |  B1 (4.60)  |
:::

What can we tell about the experiment by looking at this layout?

\
\

\newpage

We'll need to identify the whole plot experimental unit for SAS. Let's first use `proc mixed`, just so we can see the expected mean squares and make sure we've correctly identified the whole plot experimental unit.

```         
    proc mixed method=type3;
      class rep A B;
      model y=A B A*B;
      random rep(A);
    run;
```

![SAS output from PROC MIXED for the analysis of a split-plot](splitplotanova.jpg){fig-alt="The figure provided the output from SAS for the analysis of a split-plot carried out as a CRD. The Expected Mean Squares show the different error terms." width="80%"}

So the $F$ value for Factor A is $F=2.98$. This comes from

\
\
\

For the A $\times$ B interaction, the $F$ value is $F=0.40$. This comes from

\

\newpage

**Example:** A researcher is studying the absorption times of a particular type of antibiotic capsule. There are three dosage strengths and 4 capsule wall thicknesses, so 12 total treatment combinations. The researcher has decided on four replicates and it is necessary to run each replicate on a different day, so the researcher plans to block on day. On each day, each dosage strength is formulated. Once a particular dosage strength is formulated, all four wall thicknesses are tested at that strength. Then another dosage strength is selected, and all four wall thicknesses are tested. Finally, the third dosage strength and the four wall thicknesses are tested.

The experimental layout looks like this (everything would be appropriately randomized):

::: center
|       | Day 1 |       |       | Day 2 |       |       | Day 3 |       |
|-------|:-----:|-------|-------|:-----:|-------|-------|:-----:|-------|
| Dose1 | Dose2 | Dose3 | Dose1 | Dose2 | Dose3 | Dose1 | Dose2 | Dose3 |
| Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 | Wall1 |
| Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 | Wall2 |
| Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 | Wall3 |
| Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 | Wall4 |
:::

-   Block:\
-   Main plot treatment factor:\
-   Main plot experimental unit:\
-   Subplot treatment factor:\
-   Subplot experimental unit:\

So, we'll put

\

in the random statement to identify main plot error.

Again, we'll use `proc mixed`, just so we can see the expected mean squares and make sure we've correctly identified the whole plot experimental unit.

```         
proc mixed data=antibiotic method=type3;
  class day dosage wall;
  model time=day dosage wall dosage*wall;
  random day*dosage;
run;
```

\newpage

![PROC MIXED analysis of the antibiotic capsule data](antibiotic%20mixed.jpg){fig-alt="The figure shows the output of the PROC MIXED analysis of the antibiotic capsule data." width="90%"}

So the $F$ value for dosage strength is $F=315.92$. This comes from

\
\
\

For the wall thickness effect, the $F$ value is $F=48.94$. This comes from

\
\

We could also consider day as a random effect. We'll go back to `proc glimmix`, since we no longer need the expected mean squares:

```         
    proc glimmix data=antibiotic;
      class day dosage wall;
      model time=dosage wall dosage*wall;
      random day day*dosage;
    run;
```

\newpage

Here's part of the output

These don't match what we had with fixed days, and weird things are happening! What do you notice?

    proc glimmix data=antibiotic nobound;
      class day dosage wall;
      model time=dosage wall dosage*wall;
      random day day*dosage;

    dosage*wall       6       27       4.38    0.0033
```

What do you notice now?

\
\
\
\

Let's treat blocks as fixed, just for the sake of demonstrating how we should be estimating treatment means and differences in a split-plot experiment.

The model with blocks:

\
\
\
\
\
\

The main plot treatment mean is $\mu_{i\cdot}$, and the natural estimator is $\overline y_{i\cdot \cdot} = \frac{1}{rb}\sum_{k=1}^b \sum_{j=1}^r y_{ijk}$. For the antibiotic data with dosage strength 1, we get

\begin{eqnarray*}
    \overline y_{i\cdot \cdot} &=& \frac{1}{(4)(4)} [ (95 + 104 + 101 + 108) + (95 + 106 + 103 + 109) \\
    & & + (96 + 105 + 106 + 113) + (90 + 100 + 102 + 114) ] \\
    &=& \frac{1}{16} (408 + 413 + 420 + 406) = 102.9375\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\newpage

The hardest part is obtaining the estimate of the variance of the mean. First, keep in mind

-   
\

-   
\

To figure out the variance of $\overline y_{i\cdot \cdot}$, let's think about what it's actually estimating (assuming balanced data and fixed blocks):

$$\overline y_{i\cdot \cdot} = \frac{1}{rb}\sum_{k=1}^b \sum_{j=1}^r y_{ijk} =  \frac{1}{rb}\sum_{k=1}^b \sum_{j=1}^r (\mu_{ij} + R_j + w_{ij} + e_{ijk})$$ So,

\
\
\
\
\
\

\newpage

Let's check this in SAS

```         
                          Standard
    dosage    Estimate       Error       DF    t Value    Pr > |t|
    
    1           102.94      0.8790        6     117.11      <.0001
```

What about differences between two whole plot treatment means? We estimate $\mu_{i\cdot} - \mu_{i'\cdot}$ with $\overline y_{i\cdot \cdot} - \overline y_{i'\cdot \cdot}$, and estimate the variance of the difference with

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

Checking in SAS:

```         
                    Differences of dosage Least Squares Means
                                     Standard
    dosage    _dosage    Estimate       Error       DF    t Value    Pr > |t|
    
    1         2           21.1250      1.2430        6      16.99      <.0001
    1         3           -9.3750      1.2430        6      -7.54      0.0003
    2         3          -30.5000      1.2430        6     -24.54      <.0001
```

Estimating the variance of the difference between simple effects gets even more complicated, so we'll just let SAS do it. But, we do need to be aware that depending on the form of the standard error, the default degrees of freedom calculated by SAS may or may not be correct. Any time the standard error cannot be estimated by a single mean square (for many simple effects), the degrees of freedom must be estimated. We can do this by asking SAS to use the Kenward-Roger approximation to the degrees of freedom.

```         
    proc glimmix data=antibiotic;
      class day dosage wall;
      model time=day dosage wall dosage*wall/ddfm=kr;
      random day*dosage;
      lsmeans dosage/pdiff;
      lsmeans dosage*wall/pdiff;
    run;
```
\newpage

## More Complicated Split-Plot Designs

The concept of split-plot designs can be extended to

-   Split-split-plot designs (or more splits). Sub-plot units are themselves further divided into sub-sub-plot units.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

-   Split block/Strip-split plot designs. These lead to 3 different experimental units: for A, B, and A $\times$ B.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\


-   Repeated measures designs. One of the factors is time, and measurements are taken repeatedly on the same experimental unit.
